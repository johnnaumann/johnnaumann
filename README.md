### 👋 Hi, I’m John Naumann

I’m a **front-end engineer, creative technologist, and generative artist** exploring the boundaries between **code, data, and visual storytelling**. With a background in **design-driven React/Next.js engineering** and a passion for **art–technology hybrids**, I build tools, systems, and visuals where software becomes an expressive medium.

### 🚀 What I’m Working On

- **🔬 Research & Writing** — Documenting workflows for **generative art engineering** on [Substack](https://johnnaumann.substack.com/), bridging modern web dev practices (version control, modular pipelines) with creative coding.
- **💻 Software Development** — Delivering **high-quality front-end solutions** as a [Toptal developer](https://talent.toptal.com/resume/developers/john-robert-naumann) and collaborating with product teams on **React/Next.js** and **design systems**.
- **🎨 Generative Practice** — Creating **data-driven visual artworks** using code and AI, featured on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anthropo_scenic_/).
- **🤝 Tech & Design Networks** — Connecting with developers, artists, and creative technologists on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-naumann-b438b42bb/).

### 🎯 Current Focus

I’m developing **Anthroposcenic** — a platform and visual series exploring how **sensor data from drones** can be transformed into **algorithmic landscapes**. The project investigates how **code + computation** can reveal unseen patterns in geography, climate, and human impact.

### 🧩 Core Expertise

- **Front-End Engineering** — React, Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind, ShadCN, design tokens, and UI system architecture
- **Creative Tech & AI** — Procedural image generation, generative art workflows, LLM-driven pipelines (Cursor + MCP + Python), and design automation
- **Design Systems** — Figma → code integration, atomic components, scalable token frameworks
- **Product & Entrepreneurship** — Building and scaling digital products, property tech experiments, and AI-powered insights tools

### 💡 Always Exploring

I’m interested in **how modern software engineering can empower art, research, and creative production** — from **agentic AI workflows** to **generative visual systems** and **hybrid design/dev practices**.
