### 👋 Hi, I’m John Naumann

I’m a **Senior UI Engineer** working with [Toptal](https://talent.toptal.com/resume/developers/john-robert-naumann), specialising in **design-driven front-end development**. My work blends **Figma-based design systems** with modern frameworks such as **React, Next.js, and Expo** to build polished, scalable user interfaces.

### ✍️ Writing & Research

On [Substack](https://johnnaumann.substack.com/), I write about the intersection of **technology, art, and code** — currently exploring **agentic AI workflows for generative art**. My goal is to document and share how modern software engineering practices can empower creative production.

### 🎨 Generative Art

I create **generative and procedural artworks**, often transforming real-world data into rich visual narratives. My latest series, **Anthroposcenic**, explores how sensor and drone data can be turned into algorithmic landscapes. You can find my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anthropo_scenic_/).

### 🤝 Open to Collaboration

I’m always interested in connecting with other **engineers, artists, and creative technologists** to explore new ideas and build meaningful projects at the intersection of art and code. Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-naumann-b438b42bb/).
