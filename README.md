I’m a **Senior UI Engineer** working with [Toptal](https://talent.toptal.com/resume/developers/john-robert-naumann), specialising in **design-driven front-end development**. My work blends **Figma-based design systems** with modern frameworks such as **React, Next.js, and Expo** to build polished, scalable user interfaces.

### Writing & Research

On [Substack](https://johnnaumann.substack.com/), I write about the intersection of **technology, art, and code** — currently exploring **agentic AI workflows for generative art**. My goal is to document and share how modern software engineering practices can empower creative production.

### Generative Art

I create **generative and procedural artworks**, often transforming real-world data into rich visual narratives. My latest series, **Anthroposcenic**, explores how sensor and drone data can be turned into algorithmic landscapes. You can find my work on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/anthropo_scenic_/).

### Teaching

I am a previous lecturer at [Harbour Space](https://harbour.space/faculty/john-pett), a leading technolgy univeristy, teaching about creative coding systems. I have also previously taught courses for [Cyber Patio](https://www.instagram.com/cyberpatio).

### Open to Collaboration

I’m always interested in connecting with other **engineers, artists, and creative technologists** to explore new ideas and build meaningful projects at the intersection of the visual arts and code. Let’s connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-naumann-b438b42bb/).
